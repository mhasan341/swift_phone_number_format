# swift_phone_number_format
Simple function to take a number saved in phone and return a standard 11 digit US format.
Can be customized to format for other countries. 
Code snippent has been taken from my Social app project (US).
This code can format any number that is in one of the following format.

```
+12223334444  
2223334444  
0012223334444  
+1 (222) 333 4444  
+1-222-333-4444  
```

The goal is to return ```+12223334444```
